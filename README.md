# AutoAI-PC-Assistant

AutoAI-PC-Assistant will be a intelligent automation tool that leverages a large language model (LLM) to execute complex tasks on a user's Windows PC. This tool integrates GUI automation and PowerShell scripting to streamline workflows and perform actions based on natural language commands.

---

## Proposed Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Use a simple command-line prompt to give tasks using natural language.
- **GUI Automation**: Leverages `pywinauto` to interact with Windows-native applications and perform actions through the graphical interface.
- **PowerShell Scripting**: Executes system-level tasks using PowerShell when direct command execution is more efficient.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Uses OpenCV for additional real-time visual analysis and context of tasks performed on the PC.
- **Error Handling**: Provides step-by-step task progression with feedback on success or failure.
